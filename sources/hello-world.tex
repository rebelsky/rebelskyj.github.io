``Hello World!'' is one of the first \footnote{if not the first\\}
pieces of code that I \footnote{and stereotypically everyone\\} learn to
code when learning a new language. There are a variety of reasons for
this, none of which I am aware of. However, it's still a great way to
start this blog.\\
Speaking of starting, I'm starting this blog for three major reasons
\footnote{in order of thinking progression\\}:\\
1. Someone asked me if I would be sending email updates about my time
abroad \\
2. I like having a forced place to write \\
3. As my tagline notes, my father also writes \footnote{hopefully much
  more coherently} daily essays. \\
So, expect to see some updates about travel, my life abroad, and
whatever else happens to be on my mind when I sit down to write.
